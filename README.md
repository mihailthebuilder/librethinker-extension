## Getting started

Fetch your OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys

Set the key as the `LT_LLM_API_KEY` environment variable in your operating system.

Download the extension: https://github.com/mihailthebuilder/librethinker-extension/releases/download/v0.1.0/LibreThinker.oxt

After downloading the extension file (.oxt), you need to install it in LibreOffice Writer. Either double-click the .oxt file, or open LibreOffice Writer, go to Tools > Extension Manager > Add, and select the downloaded .oxt file.
